# LLMs Architecture 
![Alt Text](images/Transformer.png)


This repository contains implementations of **LLMs**
---

Implemented Architectures
1. **GPT2**
2. **BERT**
3. **Llama**

## 📚 Description  

This repository is structured as follows:
1. **Data** Folder contains small text files for simple training 
2. **GPT2** Folder contains training, model, textsampler 
3. **BERT** Folder contains Bert Model and Bert Modules
4. **Llama** Folder contains Llama Model with GQA and RoPE Modules  

---

## 🚀 Goals  
- Implement and experiment with different model architecture. 
- Develop foundational components for future research in **transformers**.
- Provide clean and modular code.
